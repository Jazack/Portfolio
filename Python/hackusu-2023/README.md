# hackusu-2023
This project was created for the hack USU 2023 event over the space of March 24th at 4:00 p.m. to March 25th at 4:00 p.m.
I worked with 2 others, Jon Jolly and his son.
The files that I developed are:
creatures.py
items.py
room.py

This is a rogue-like game developed in python that can be run in browser via pyscript, it can also be run in console. We developed it so that there is the backend that keeps track of all the game info, it also generates what the monsters do with low-level AI, and it generates random levels, this was developed by me. Then there is the game engine that will take the user input, communicate with the backend side, and then update the frontend side about what changed, this was developed by Jon Jolly. And finally there is the frontend side, which will display to the user his options, and communicate input received to the game engine, this was developed by Jon Jolly's son.
