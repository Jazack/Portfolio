My portfolio is divided into the main languages that I used for each project. The best items to look at are:
BlackJack -- this is in the C++ section, it is a simple game of blackjack
Python Gone Rogue -- this is in the Python section, this is a roguelike game developed for HackUSU2023, I developed the backend section.
Heroscape Army Organizer -- this is in the Python section, this is a SQLite database manager
